# Electricity Demand Forecasting

This repository contains a study on electricity demand forecasting using three distinct models: **SARIMA**, **LSTM**, and **XGBoost**. The goal is to evaluate and compare their performance in predicting weekly electricity consumption data from the National Grid ESO.

## Objectives:
- **Model Development & Evaluation**: Develop SARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost models for load forecasting and assess prediction accuracy and errors.
- **Comparison Metrics**: Compare model performance using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and Adjusted R-squared.
- **Complexity Handling**: Analyze how each model addresses the non-linear and complex nature of electricity demand.
- **Residual Analysis**: Present visual comparisons of forecasted vs actual demand and diagnose residuals to assess model fit.

## Scope:
- **Model Application**: Implementing SARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost to predict electricity consumption.
- **Data Utilization**: Using weekly consumption data from the National Grid ESO, including preprocessing, missing value handling, and feature engineering.
- **Comparison Framework**: Comparing models based on forecasting accuracy and effectiveness in handling demand complexities.

## Requirements:
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `tensorflow`, `xgboost`
